# GameEngine

This game engine was created using C++ and the libraries Modern OpenGl, Glew and FreeGlut.

This game engine is capable of: 
- rendering a complex scene graph 
- lighting a 3D scene by implementing various different lighting models (eg. Blinn-Phong model, Gaussian model)
- using shadow mapping for a dynamic number of light sources
- texturing and normal mapping to create more realistic objects
- adding automatically imported 3D objects quickly to the scene
- animating characters with several joints and components

The following video showcases the engine's capabilities with a very simple version of the game Bomberman.
